# Setup Matt Pocock's Skills

Scaffold the per-repo configuration that the engineering skills assume:

- **Issue tracker** — where issues live (GitHub by default; local markdown is also supported out of the box)
- **Triage labels** — the strings used for the five canonical triage roles
- **Domain docs** — the AGENTS/DOX hierarchy where domain language and architectural decisions live, and the consumer rules for reading it

This is a prompt-driven skill, not a deterministic script. Explore, present what you found, confirm with the user, then write.

## Process

### 1. Explore

Look at the current repo to understand its starting state. Read whatever exists; don't assume:

- `git remote -v` and `.git/config` — is this a GitHub repo? Which one?
- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root — does either exist? Is there already an `## Agent skills` section in either?
- Every `AGENTS.md` from the repo root down — what DOX hierarchy already exists, and do the documents have `## Change Protocol`, `## Ubiquitous Language`, `## Architectural Decisions`, or `## Child DOX Index` sections?
- `docs/agents/` — does this skill's prior output already exist?
- `.scratch/` — sign that a local-markdown issue tracker convention is already in use

### 2. Present findings and ask

Summarise what's present and what's missing. Then walk the user through the two configurable decisions and the fixed domain-doc convention **one at a time** — present a section, get the user's answer or confirmation, then move to the next. Don't dump all three at once.

Assume the user does not know what these terms mean. Each section starts with a short explainer (what it is, why these skills need it, what changes if they pick differently). For Sections A and B, show the choices and the default; for Section C, show the fixed convention and its root-only default.

**Section A — Issue tracker.**

> Explainer: The "issue tracker" is where issues live for this repo. Skills like `to-tickets`, `triage`, `to-spec`, and `qa` read from and write to it — they need to know whether to call `gh issue create`, write a markdown file under `.scratch/`, or follow some other workflow you describe. Pick the place you actually track work for this repo.

Default posture: these skills were designed for GitHub. If a `git remote` points at GitHub, propose that. If a `git remote` points at GitLab (`gitlab.com` or a self-hosted host), propose GitLab. Otherwise (or if the user prefers), offer:

- **GitHub** — issues live in the repo's GitHub Issues (uses the `gh` CLI)
- **GitLab** — issues live in the repo's GitLab Issues (uses the [`glab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli) CLI)
- **Local markdown** — issues live as files under `.scratch/<feature>/` in this repo (good for solo projects or repos without a remote)
- **Other** (Jira, Linear, etc.) — ask the user to describe the workflow in one paragraph; the skill will record it as freeform prose

If — and only if — the user picked **GitHub** or **GitLab**, ask one follow-up:

> Explainer: Open-source repos often receive feature requests as pull requests, not just issues — a PR is an issue with attached code. If you turn this on, `/triage` pulls *external* PRs into the same queue and runs them through the same labels and states as issues (collaborators' in-flight PRs are left alone). Leave it off if PRs aren't a request surface for you.

- **PRs as a request surface** — yes / no (default: no). Record the answer in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`. For local-markdown and other trackers, skip this question — there are no PRs.

**Section B — Triage label vocabulary.**

> Explainer: When the `triage` skill processes an incoming issue, it moves it through a state machine — needs evaluation, waiting on reporter, ready for an AFK agent to pick up, ready for a human, or won't fix. To do that, it needs to apply labels (or the equivalent in your issue tracker) that match strings *you've actually configured*. If your repo already uses different label names (e.g. `bug:triage` instead of `needs-triage`), map them here so the skill applies the right ones instead of creating duplicates.

The five canonical roles:

- `needs-triage` — maintainer needs to evaluate
- `needs-info` — waiting on reporter
- `ready-for-agent` — fully specified, AFK-ready (an agent can pick it up with no human context)
- `ready-for-human` — needs human implementation
- `wontfix` — will not be actioned

Default: each role's string equals its name. Ask the user if they want to override any. If their issue tracker has no existing labels, the defaults are fine.

**Section C — Domain docs.**

> Explainer: Some skills (`improve-codebase-architecture`, `diagnosing-bugs`, `tdd`) read the applicable `AGENTS.md` chain to learn the project's domain language and past architectural decisions. The chain runs from the repo root to the nearest document that owns the area being changed; parent language and decisions are inherited. Domain language lives inline under `## Ubiquitous Language`, globally numbered ADR entries live inline under `## Architectural Decisions`, and each parent keeps its `## Child DOX Index` current.

This layout is not configurable. Present the hierarchy you found and confirm that its ownership boundaries match the repo:

- **Root `AGENTS.md`** — repository-wide language, decisions, and inherited contracts.
- **Child `AGENTS.md` files** — app-, package-, or subtree-specific additions, created only for durable local boundaries and linked from the parent's `## Child DOX Index`.

Default: keep a root-only chain unless the repo already has, or clearly needs, a durable child boundary. Follow the nearest owning document's `## Change Protocol`; don't create empty domain-language or decision sections upfront.

### 3. Confirm and edit

Show the user a draft of:

- The `## Agent skills` block to add to whichever of `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` is being edited (see step 4 for selection rules)
- Any minimal changes needed to establish the root `AGENTS.md` and keep its DOX chain coherent
- The contents of `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`, `docs/agents/domain.md`

Let them edit before writing.

### 4. Write

**Pick the file for the `## Agent skills` block:**

- If `CLAUDE.md` exists, edit it.
- Otherwise, edit the root `AGENTS.md`, creating it if necessary.

Always ensure a root `AGENTS.md` exists to anchor the DOX chain, even when the `## Agent skills` block lives in `CLAUDE.md`. Preserve existing instructions and follow its `## Change Protocol`. When creating or substantially structuring it, use the `/domain-modeling` skill's [AGENTS-FORMAT.md](../domain-modeling/AGENTS-FORMAT.md); use [ADR-FORMAT.md](../domain-modeling/ADR-FORMAT.md) for inline decisions. Create domain sections and child documents lazily, only when they have useful content.

If an `## Agent skills` block already exists in the chosen file, update its contents in-place rather than appending a duplicate. Don't overwrite user edits to the surrounding sections.

The block:

```markdown
## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

[one-line summary of where issues are tracked, plus whether external PRs are a triage surface]. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

[one-line summary of the label vocabulary]. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

[one-line summary of the root-to-nearest AGENTS/DOX hierarchy]. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
```

Then write the three docs files using the seed templates in this skill folder as a starting point:

- [issue-tracker-github.md](./issue-tracker-github.md) — GitHub issue tracker
- [issue-tracker-gitlab.md](./issue-tracker-gitlab.md) — GitLab issue tracker
- [issue-tracker-local.md](./issue-tracker-local.md) — local-markdown issue tracker
- [triage-labels.md](./triage-labels.md) — label mapping
- [domain.md](./domain.md) — consumer rules for the AGENTS/DOX hierarchy

For "other" issue trackers, write `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` from scratch using the user's description.

### 5. Done

Tell the user the setup is complete and which engineering skills will now read from these files and the applicable `AGENTS.md` chain. Mention they can edit `docs/agents/*.md` and the owning `AGENTS.md` directly later — re-running this skill is only necessary if they want to switch issue trackers or restart from scratch.
